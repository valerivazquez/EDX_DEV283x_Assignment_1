EDX_DEV283x_Assignment_1
========================


-1. Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome?

    I had a trouble with convert json to string for file, and how to manage the errors with the asyncromous module "csvtojson"

    You can execute it with: npm run-script converter

-2. How did you test your project to verify that it works? 

    I use mocha, you can test it with the commmand: npm test

    Keep in mind, that need to install de module "mocha": https://mochajs.org/#installation



-3. Let us know if anything doesn't work as intended so your reviewer will know ahead of time

    I had problems with testing with asyncronous module, for that reason I had to include some delay in the test.
